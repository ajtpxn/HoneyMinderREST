Goal Tracking with Rewards

https://www.honeyminder.com


Honey Minder is a way to track goals with rewards. The idea is similar to Beeminder (https://www.beeminder.com) but with rewards instead of punishments. The user will have a field to write down the reward they want to give themselves and, if the user stays on track with the commitment, Honey Minder will tell them when they have earned their reward.

### Next Steps ###

* Build out JUnit tests for TDD of the REST API
* Build out the API with basic CRUD for goals
* Add corresponding functionality to the front end
* Build out admin features

### Technologies Used ###

* I am hoping that I will be able to increase my happiness by being more productive on things I really care about. I hope I can help others to do the same.
